Firezone is an open-source, WireGuard-based platform designed for secure, zero-trust remote access. Its use cases focus on providing secure, scalable, and easy-to-manage access to private resources without exposing them to the public internet. Below is an overview of Firezone’s key use cases, based on information from its official documentation and relevant sources, tailored to the context of your interest in a web app like WGDashboard with Caddy integration.[](https://www.firezone.dev/)[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases)

### Firezone Use Cases
Firezone leverages WireGuard’s performance and its own hole-punching technology to establish secure, on-demand tunnels. Here are the primary use cases, with details on how they relate to your proposed web app:

1. **Secure Access to Private Networks**  
   - **Description**: Firezone enables secure access to private subnets (e.g., homelabs, VPCs) behind firewalls without opening ports. It’s ideal for accessing internal networks from external locations, such as remote offices or personal devices.[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases/private-network-access)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: Similar to your goal of connecting internal servers via a WireGuard VPN, Firezone allows clients to access private networks using CIDR-based resources. You could integrate Caddy as a load balancer to route traffic from Firezone’s gateways to multiple internal servers, enhancing flexibility for your web app.
   - **Example**: Accessing a homelab’s private subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) from a remote client without exposing it to the internet.

2. **Access to Specific Hosts by Private IP**  
   - **Description**: Firezone secures access to individual hosts using their private IP addresses, supporting services like SSH or RDP. This is useful for managing servers or devices behind NAT or firewalls.[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases/host-access)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: Your app’s goal of switching between internal servers aligns with this use case. Firezone’s IP-based resource management could be paired with Caddy’s load balancing to dynamically route traffic to specific hosts based on user input or load.
   - **Example**: Securely accessing a server at 192.168.1.10 for SSH from a remote client.

3. **Secure Access to Private Web Applications**  
   - **Description**: Firezone provides secure access to private web apps (e.g., GitLab, Metabase) hosted behind firewalls, using DNS-based resources. Multiple gateways can be deployed for load balancing high-traffic apps.[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases/web-app-access)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: This directly aligns with your idea of using Caddy as a load balancer. Firezone’s gateway load balancing can be enhanced by Caddy’s reverse proxy and load balancing capabilities to distribute traffic across internal web servers, manageable via a WGDashboard-like UI.
   - **Example**: Securing access to a self-hosted GitLab instance at `gitlab.internal` with Caddy routing traffic to multiple backend servers.

4. **Database Access (e.g., Postgres)**  
   - **Description**: Firezone secures access to databases like Postgres behind firewalls, using DNS or IP-based resources. Multiple gateways ensure load balancing for high-traffic database services.[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases/postgres-access)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: Your app could extend this by allowing users to configure Caddy to balance database traffic across replicated nodes, with a UI to manage connections and monitor performance.
   - **Example**: Accessing a Postgres database at `db.internal:5432` securely from a remote client.

5. **Routing Traffic Through a Public IP (NAT Gateway)**  
   - **Description**: Firezone routes team traffic through a single public IP for services requiring IP allowlists, simplifying access control for consulting engagements or privacy needs.[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases/nat-gateway)[](https://www.firezone.dev/docs/user-guides/use-cases/nat-gateway)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: While your app focuses on internal server access, Caddy could route traffic from Firezone’s gateways to internal servers while presenting a single public IP to external services, enhancing security and simplicity.
   - **Example**: Routing traffic to `*.gitlab.company.com` through a Firezone gateway’s public IP (e.g., 52.202.88.54).

6. **Blocking Malicious DNS Queries**  
   - **Description**: Firezone improves internet security by configuring custom DNS resolvers to block malicious or unwanted DNS queries, preventing malware or phishing attacks.[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases/secure-dns)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: This is less directly related but could be a feature in your app, allowing admins to configure DNS settings via the UI, with Caddy handling traffic routing to secure DNS resolvers.
   - **Example**: Using Firezone to route DNS queries through a resolver like Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 to block malicious domains.

7. **Scaling VPC Access**  
   - **Description**: Firezone scales access to Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using multiple gateways, supporting automated deployments via Terraform.[](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/use-cases/scale-vpc-access)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: Your app could integrate with Firezone’s gateway model, using Caddy to distribute traffic across multiple VPC-hosted servers, with the UI managing gateway and load balancer configurations.
   - **Example**: Scaling access to an AWS VPC (e.g., CIDR 10.0.0.0/16) with multiple Firezone gateways and Caddy load balancing.

8. **Reverse Tunneling**  
   - **Description**: Firezone acts as a relay to connect devices behind NAT or firewalls, enabling access to servers or containers for administrators.[](https://www.firezone.dev/docs/user-guides/use-cases/reverse-tunnel)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: This use case supports your goal of connecting to internal servers. Caddy could enhance this by routing tunneled traffic to specific internal endpoints, with the UI simplifying tunnel management.
   - **Example**: Establishing a tunnel between a remote admin device and a server behind NAT for maintenance.

9. **Split Tunneling**  
   - **Description**: Firezone allows split tunneling by configuring `AllowedIPs` to route only specific traffic (e.g., a CIDR range like 3.5.140.0/22) through the VPN, leaving other traffic unaffected.[](https://www.firezone.dev/docs/user-guides/use-cases/split-tunnel)
   - **Relevance to Your Project**: Your app could include a UI to configure split tunneling rules, with Caddy managing the routing of tunneled traffic to internal servers.
   - **Example**: Routing only traffic to 3.5.140.0/22 through the VPN for an AWS region-specific service.

### Relevance to Your Web App
Firezone’s use cases overlap significantly with your proposed web app:
- **WireGuard Integration**: Like WGDashboard, Firezone uses WireGuard for fast, secure VPN tunnels, making it a natural fit for your project.
- **Web UI**: Firezone’s admin UI is similar to WGDashboard, offering resource and policy management. You could build a comparable UI with Vue.js or React, adding controls for Caddy’s load balancing rules.
- **Load Balancing**: Firezone supports multiple gateways for load balancing, which complements your idea of using Caddy. For example, you could configure Caddy to balance traffic across Firezone gateways or directly to internal servers:
  ```caddyfile
  vpn.example.com {
      load_balance {
          policy round_robin
          backends 192.168.1.10:80 192.168.1.20:80
      }
  }
  ```
- **Authentication**: Firezone supports email, Google Workspace, Okta, Entra ID, and OIDC. Your app could add local authentication (e.g., via Caddy’s `basicauth`) to address Reddit users’ preferences for non-SSO solutions.[](https://github.com/firezone/firezone)
- **Docker Deployment**: Firezone’s lightweight Linux gateways and Docker support align with your Docker-based deployment goal, making it easy to package with Caddy and a custom UI.

### Comparison to Your Proposed App
- **Similarities**: Firezone’s focus on secure, user-friendly access to private resources mirrors your app’s goals. Its web UI and WireGuard foundation are similar to WGDashboard, and its gateway model supports load balancing, which Caddy can enhance.
- **Differences**: Firezone is more enterprise-focused, with features like SSO and Terraform automation, while your app targets simplicity and homelab use. Firezone doesn’t natively use Caddy, so your app’s explicit Caddy integration for load balancing is unique.
- **Demand on Reddit**: As noted in your original query, Reddit discussions (e.g., r/selfhosted, r/WireGuard) show demand for simple, self-hosted WireGuard UIs with local authentication. Firezone’s complexity might deter some homelab users, creating an opportunity for your app to offer a lighter alternative with Caddy’s load balancing.

### Recommendations
- **Extend Firezone**: Instead of building from scratch, consider forking Firezone’s open-source codebase (available on GitHub under Apache 2.0 and Elastic License 2.0) and adding Caddy integration. Modify its UI to include controls for Caddy’s load balancing rules and local authentication.[](https://github.com/firezone/firezone)
- **Simplify for Homelabs**: Focus on a WGDashboard-like UI with QR code generation, client management, and Caddy configuration, targeting Reddit’s self-hosted community.
- **Community Engagement**: Share your project on r/selfhosted or r/WireGuard to validate demand, emphasizing Caddy’s load balancing and local auth as differentiators from Firezone.
